# Google Foobar

In case you don't know what Google Foobar is, it's a (very cool) hidden challenge by Google, which invites you to participate directly from the search page, if you're lucky.

I'm uploading my code for educational purpose *only*, for interested programmers to see what kind of problems they might face.

I'll also post explanations on my blog so stay tuned.
