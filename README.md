# Google Foobar

In case you don't know what Google Foobar is, it's a [very cool] hidden challenge by Google, which invites you to participate directly from the search page, if you're lucky. It has 5 levels, with increasing difficulty and a very generous time limit for each problem. 

I'm uploading my code for educational purpose *only*, for interested programmers to see what kind of problems they might face. The codes will be uploaded periodically so not to upset folks at Google!

I'll also post explanations on my blog so stay tuned.
